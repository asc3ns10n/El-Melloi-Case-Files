Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.20,0:08:01.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Aptly put, Lady. "Cage" is the perfect word for it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.04,0:08:05.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Master, might it be that Sir Fargo's killer is among the four?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.20,0:08:08.98,Default,,0,0,0,,This mansion was enclosed by a powerful bounded field on the day of the incident.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.88,0:09:03.24,Default,,0,0,0,,worn long to hide the marks of that very abuse.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.24,0:09:04.64,Default,,0,0,0,,How horrid.
